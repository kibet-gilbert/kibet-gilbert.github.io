# About Me  

I am a genomics & bioinformatics **data scientist** at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Nairobi. The research I am engaged in seeks a deeper scientific understanding of pathogens, their hosts and habitats through bioinformatics and computational analysis of biological and genomic data. I also promote open reproducible scientific research. Technically, I work in a genomics lab to test, sequence and analyse microbial, animal and environmental samples.   

I have been privileged to work on viral (SARs-CoV-2, MERS, Influenza A, Hepatitis E), bacterial, wastewater (shotgun metagenomic) and 10X single-cell NGS data.

# *My Area of Expertise*.

---

## **Data management**:

✔ **Data Collection:** Gathering raw data from various sources (e.g., clinical studies, experiments, surveys).  
✔ **Data Storage:** Securely storing data in structured databases, cloud storage, or high-performance computing environments.  
✔ **Data Cleaning:** Removing errors, duplicates, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.  
✔ **Data Standardization:** Formatting data consistently using recognized standards (e.g., **ISO 8601 for dates, MIxS for metadata**).  
✔ **Data Security & Privacy:** Implementing protection measures (encryption, access control) to safeguard sensitive data.  
✔ **Data Sharing & Accessibility:** Ensuring data is **FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)** to facilitate collaboration.  
✔ **Data Archiving:** Long-term storage and preservation of datasets for future reference or regulatory requirements.

## **Bioinformatics Pipeline-Development and Genomics Analysis**:

I develop and maintain fast, scalable and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines for short and long-read sequence data based on Linux, git&GitHub and workflow management engines (Nextflow).  

✔ **Recent Projects I have worked on**:

 - _Wastewater Shotgun metagenomics for Pathogen and AMR Surveillance_  
 - _Whole Genome Sequencing, assembly, variant calling and annotation_  
 - _10X Single-cell analysis_  
 - _Phylogenomics and phylogeography of Vectors and Pests_  

Besides Data Management and Analysis, I have experience with:  
✔ **High-Performance Computing** based on own or open source tools and job-schedulers (SLURM);  
✔ **Statistical analysis (R/Python) and generating publication-ready figures**: graphs, trees, networks.  
✔ **Sequencers I work with**: Illumina MiSeq, NextSeq550 and 2000 and ONT.  

Outside research I train early‑career bioinformaticians in reproducible analysis and FAIR data stewardship.
